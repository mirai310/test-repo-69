Code of Conduct
Help me keep my project open and inclusive. Please read and follow my Code of Conduct.

Do not open issues for general support questions as I want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests.

I will systematically close all issues that are requests for general support and redirect people to Stack Overflow.


Found a Bug?
If you find a bug in the source code, you can help me by submitting an issue to my GitHub Repository. Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

Missing a Feature?
You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to my GitHub Repository. If you would like to implement a new feature, please consider the size of the change in order to determine the right steps to proceed:

For a Major Feature, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be discussed. This process allows us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.

Note: Adding a new topic to the documentation, or significantly re-writing a topic, counts as a major feature.

Small Features can be crafted and directly submitted as a Pull Request.

Submission Guidelines
Submitting an Issue
Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker. An issue for your problem might already exist and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug, we need to reproduce and confirm it. In order to reproduce bugs, I require that you provide a minimal reproduction. Having a minimal reproducible scenario gives me a wealth of important information without going back and forth to you with additional questions.

A minimal reproduction allows us to quickly confirm a bug (or point out a coding problem) as well as confirm that we are fixing the right problem.

I require a minimal reproduction to save maintainers' time and ultimately be able to fix more bugs. Often, developers find coding problems themselves while preparing a minimal reproduction. I understand that sometimes it might be hard to extract essential bits of code from a larger codebase, but I really need to isolate the problem before I can fix it.

Unfortunately, I am not able to investigate / fix bugs without a minimal reproduction, so if I don't hear back from you, I am going to close an issue that doesn't have enough info to be reproduced.

You can file new issues by selecting from my new issue templates and filling out the issue template.
